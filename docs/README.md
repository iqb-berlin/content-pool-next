# IQB ContentPool Documentation

This folder contains the main project documentation for the ContentPool application.
The repository is a split Angular frontend and NestJS backend that manages Assessment
Content Packages (ACPs), their files, access rules, review workflows, and external
transfer APIs.

## Start Here

If you are new to the project, read the documentation in this order:

1. [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
2. [Getting Started](development/getting-started.md)
3. [Access Control](features/access-control.md)
4. [ACP Workflows](features/acp-workflows.md)
5. [Deployment](operations/deployment.md)

For ACP managers who need a task-oriented user guide, see:

- [ACP-Manager Handbuch](manuals/acp-manager-manual.md)

## Documentation Map

### Architecture

- [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)

  Automated test commands, manual verification flows, and release-quality checks.

### Features

- [Access Control](features/access-control.md)
  Authentication methods, access models, roles, feature flags, and route/guard behavior.

  How ACPs are created, populated, configured, versioned, and reviewed.

- [ACP-Manager Handbuch](manuals/acp-manager-manual.md)
  Task-oriented guide for day-to-day ACP management in the current UI.

### Operations

- [Releases and Promotion](operations/releases.md)
  SemVer, release candidates, staging evidence, digest promotion, rollback, and restore.
- [Deployment](operations/deployment.md)
  Development, production, server-image, and single-domain Traefik deployment modes.
- [Monitoring and Maintenance](operations/monitoring-and-maintenance.md)
  Health checks, backups, upgrades, observability, and routine operator tasks.

## Existing Root-Level Runbooks

Several operational documents already exist at the repository root and remain useful:

- [DEPLOY.md](../DEPLOY.md)
- [KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md](../KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md)
- [Keycloak Registration and ALTCHA](../keycloak/docs/REGISTRATION_AND_ALTCHA.md)
- [GITLAB_SETUP.md](../GITLAB_SETUP.md)
- [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](../RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

The files in `docs/` are intended to be the main navigable knowledge base for the
application. The root-level documents are still helpful as focused runbooks for
deployment, identity provider setup, and release readiness.

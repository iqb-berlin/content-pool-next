# Frontend Architecture

## Stack

The frontend is an Angular 21 standalone application. It uses:

- Angular router with lazy `loadComponent` routes,
- Angular `HttpClient`,
- an auth interceptor that injects the ContentPool JWT,
- small service-based state management instead of a global store,
- route guards for access flow orchestration.

The frontend is intentionally thin. Most business decisions happen on the backend.

## Application Shell

The root component lives in [`frontend/src/app/app.ts`](../../frontend/src/app/app.ts).
It provides the global header, router outlet, and runtime theme/language initialization.

At startup the app:

1. initializes auth state from browser storage,
2. fetches public settings from `/api/view/settings`,
3. applies theme CSS variables,
4. applies the configured document language.

This means even anonymous users immediately see the configured branding and legal content.

## Routing Model

Routes are defined in [`frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts`](../../frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts).
The route tree is organized by user journey:

### Public entry and auth routes

- `/`
  public landing page
- `/access`
  access explanation and redirect page
- `/login`
  login choice and sign-in entry
- `/auth/callback`
  OIDC callback handling
- `/credential-login/:acpId`
  ACP credential login page

### Manager and admin routes

- `/acps`
  list of accessible ACPs for authenticated managers/admins
- `/admin/users`
  user administration
- `/admin/settings`
  global settings administration
- `/admin/acp`
  ACP administration view
- `/manage/:acpId`
  ACP manager dashboard
- `/manage/:acpId/files`
  file manager
- `/manage/:acpId/snapshots`
  snapshot manager
- `/manage/:acpId/access`
  ACP access configuration

### Read-only view routes

- `/view/:acpId`
  ACP start page
- `/view/:acpId/units`
  unit list
- `/view/:acpId/unit/:unitId`
  single unit view
- `/view/:acpId/sequence/:sequenceId`
  task sequence view
- `/view/:acpId/items`
  item list
- `/view/:acpId/item-explorer`
  item explorer
- `/view/:acpId/item/:itemId`
  item detail view
- `/view/:acpId/index`
  ACP index browser

## Guards and Access UX

The frontend does not try to reproduce all backend authorization rules. Instead, it
uses lightweight guards to guide the user into the correct flow:

- `authGuard`
  requires login for generic authenticated pages.
- `adminGuard`
  requires login and app-admin status.
- `acpManagerGuard`
  checks that the user can access manager APIs for the ACP.
- `acpViewGuard`
  lets public ACPs through and redirects restricted ACPs to the access page.
- `itemExplorerPendingChangesGuard`
  prevents accidental navigation away from unsaved explorer changes.

The shared `AccessService` builds redirect URLs to `/access` with a reason such as:

- `login_required`,
- `insufficient_rights`,
- `feature_disabled`,
- `session_expired`.

## Authentication Flow on the Client

The central service is [`frontend/src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts`](../../frontend/src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts).

It handles:

- local JWT storage,
- OIDC PKCE redirect setup,
- OIDC code exchange,
- storing both the app JWT and OIDC tokens,
- logout broadcast across tabs,
- profile bootstrap.

A few implementation details matter operationally:

- browser storage is the source of truth for the current session,
- logout is synchronized across tabs with `BroadcastChannel`,
- downloads can append the token as `auth_token` when a regular header-based browser
  download is not practical.

## HTTP and API Layer

All HTTP access goes through [`frontend/src/app/core/services/api.service.ts`](../../frontend/src/app/core/services/api.service.ts).
The service is a thin typed wrapper around backend endpoints.

Major API groups in the client service:

- users and admin settings,
- ACP CRUD and access configuration,
- file upload and download helpers,
- snapshots,
- comments,
- public view endpoints,
- item explorer draft endpoints,
- item tags and response state.

The auth interceptor:

- adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when a token exists,
- redirects to `/access` on 401/403,
- clears invalid sessions when necessary,
- ignores inline auth errors for login endpoints so forms can show proper feedback.

## State Strategy

The frontend uses a pragmatic service-and-component state model.

Patterns used in the codebase:

- server state is fetched directly in pages and feature components,
- route parameters decide the current ACP context,
- local component state handles filters, selected items, dialogs, and temporary UI state,
- shared ACP explorer state is loaded from the backend and updated through versioned draft APIs.

There is no central client-side store such as NgRx at the moment.

## Feature-Specific UI Areas

### Admin area

The admin UI covers:

- user CRUD,
- toggling app-admin status,
- linking OIDC identities,
- editing theme, logo, language, and legal content.

### ACP manager area

The manager UI covers:

- ACP overview and dashboard,
- file lifecycle operations,
- snapshot creation and restore,
- access model and credential management, including the default private state for new ACPs.

### Read-only area

The read-only side adapts its UI based on ACP feature flags. Depending on ACP settings,
users may see or hide:

- unit navigation,
- sequence navigation,
- item list and explorer functions,
- index export,
- file download,
- commenting,
- metadata display.

## Frontend Conventions Worth Knowing

- The app uses standalone components rather than Angular NgModules.
- Download URLs are generated in the API service so components do not need to know about auth-token rules.
- Public settings are applied centrally in the root component.
- Auth and access behavior is intentionally centralized to reduce duplicated redirect logic.
- Most screens are route-driven and fetch fresh data rather than keeping long-lived cached stores.

# Access Control

## Overview

ContentPool has a layered access model. Access is not decided by one flag alone. The
effective permissions for a request depend on:

1. authentication method,
2. global app-admin status,
3. ACP-specific roles,
4. ACP access model,
5. ACP feature flags.

This gives the application a lot of flexibility without requiring completely separate
codepaths for public, managed, and restricted content.

## Supported Authentication Methods

### OIDC login

Endpoints:

- `/api/auth/oidc-config`
- `/api/auth/oidc-callback`
- `/api/auth/sync-oidc-roles`

Use case:

- all registered application users managed through Keycloak.

Important behavior:

- the frontend performs PKCE-based authorization code flow,
- the backend validates the returned ID token,
- the backend then issues its own JWT for application use.

### ACP credential login

Endpoint:

- `/api/auth/credential-login`

Use case:

- ACP-specific viewer access when the access model is `CREDENTIALS_LIST`.

Important behavior:

- credentials are stored per ACP access config,
- credential users are not normal application users,
- their access token is only valid for the associated ACP.

## Role Model

### Global role

- `APP_ADMIN`

App admins can:

- access admin settings,
- manage users,
- create and delete ACPs,
- manage any ACP,
- bypass most ACP-level restrictions.

### ACP-level roles

- `ACP_MANAGER`
- `READ_ONLY`

`ACP_MANAGER` allows write access to manager functionality for a specific ACP.
`READ_ONLY` grants authenticated access to that ACP without management rights.

## ACP Access Models

Each ACP also has an access configuration.

### `PRIVATE`

This is the default for newly created ACPs. The ACP is not listed on the public landing
page and is not reachable anonymously. Access is limited to app admins and users with an
explicit ACP role.

### `PUBLIC`

The ACP is viewable without login. Feature flags still determine what anonymous viewers
can do inside the read-only UI.

### `REGISTERED`

`REGISTERED` is an effective access state for authenticated users with an ACP role. It is
used in frontend presentation logic, but newly created access configurations are stored
with `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`, or `CREDENTIALS_LIST` as the base model.

### `CREDENTIALS_LIST`

The ACP requires ACP-specific viewer credentials. Managers configure and maintain the
username/password list through the ACP access settings.

## Who Decides Access?

### Backend authority

The backend is the final authority. `AcpAccessGuard` can grant access when:

1. the current user is an app admin,
2. the current user holds an ACP role,
3. the current token is a credential token for the ACP,
4. the ACP is public.

If none of those conditions apply, the request is rejected.

### Frontend guidance

Angular guards guide the user into the right flow:

- `adminGuard`
- `authGuard`
- `acpManagerGuard`
- `acpViewGuard`

They improve UX, but they do not replace backend authorization.

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are stored in `AcpAccessConfig.featureConfig` and mainly affect non-manager viewers.

Important supported flags include:

- `allowIndexDownload`
- `allowUnitDownload`
- `allowFileDownload`
- `enableUnitView`
- `enableSequenceNavigation`
- `enableItemList`
- `enableItemClick`
- `enableItemListFilter`
- `enableItemListSort`
- `enableItemListTags`
- `enableCommenting`
- `commentTargets`
- `showMetadata`
- `showRichText`
- `showCodingScheme`
- `metadataColumns`
- `availableTags`
- `persistUserPreferences`
- `showAudioVideoCodingVariables`
- `enablePlayerFocusHighlight`

Managers and app admins generally bypass these restrictions so they can inspect and
maintain ACP content even when public-facing features are disabled.

## Metadata Columns and Legacy Compatibility

The backend normalizes metadata-column configuration so newer `metadataColumns` values
and legacy `itemListMetadataColumns` data can coexist safely.

That matters for:

- item list column visibility,
- item explorer column order,
- backward compatibility with older ACP configuration payloads.

## Credential Security Rules

ACP credential passwords have strong validation:

- minimum 12 characters,
- at least one uppercase letter,
- at least one lowercase letter,
- at least one digit,
- at least one special character.

Credential login is also rate limited through environment variables.

## Admin-Specific OIDC Enforcement

The admin controller is protected by:

- `JwtAuthGuard`
- `OidcAuthGuard`
- `RolesGuard`

All normal application sessions are OIDC-backed. The additional guard ensures that ACP
credential tokens can never be used for admin-only configuration areas.

## Access Outcome Matrix

| User type | Can open public ACP | Can open registered ACP | Can manage ACP | Can use admin UI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anonymous visitor | Yes | No | No | No |
| Credential viewer | Only linked ACP | No | No | No |
| OIDC user with `READ_ONLY` | Yes | Yes for assigned ACP | No | No |
| OIDC user with `ACP_MANAGER` | Yes | Yes for assigned ACP | Yes for assigned ACP | No |
| OIDC app admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Access UX on the Frontend

When access is missing or expired, the frontend redirects users to `/access` with a
reason code. The UI can distinguish between:

- login required,
- insufficient rights,
- feature disabled,
- session expired.

That makes access failures more understandable than a raw 401 or 403.

# Releases and Promotion

## Release contract

`VERSION` is the canonical stable SemVer without a `v` prefix. Backend and
frontend package versions must match it. A release PR also updates the matching
`CHANGELOG.md` section and classifies database changes as `none`,
`backward-compatible`, or `manual`.

GitHub Actions is the only release authority. GitLab validation never publishes
images. Managed deployments never use `latest`, moving major/minor tags, or a
source archive from `master`.

After this workflow has been merged, a repository administrator configures the
required branch check and the protected environment once, naming a second
person as production approver:

```bash
./scripts/configure-github-release-settings.sh --reviewer RELEASE_APPROVER
```

## Release flow

1. Merge a release PR into `master` after the required `release-gate` succeeds.
2. Run **Release Candidate** from `master`, provide the RC number and the exact
   migration classification from `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. The workflow builds backend/frontend images under retryable `-build` tags
   and scans both immutable digests. Only after both scans pass does it publish
   the final `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and `sha-*` image tags, the prerelease, and
   `release-manifest.json`. Re-running an incomplete candidate reuses a build
   only after its version, source commit, and build timestamp match.

If a candidate from the older non-retryable workflow left partial RC and SHA
tags without publishing a Git tag or GitHub release, run **Cleanup Failed
Release Candidate** with that RC, its exact source commit, and the required
confirmation text. The cleanup refuses candidates with a Git tag/release and
refuses package versions carrying any additional tag.
4. Deploy the candidate to the isolated staging stack:

   ```bash
   make staging-update RELEASE=vX.Y.Z-rc.N MODE=traefik
   ```

5. Complete `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` against staging and retain the evidence URL
   or issue reference.
6. Run **Promote Release** with the candidate and staging evidence. The
   protected `production` environment requires approval. Promotion creates the
   stable Git tag and GHCR tags from the existing digests; it never rebuilds.
7. Deploy the stable release manually on production:

   ```bash
   make production-update RELEASE=vX.Y.Z MODE=traefik
   ```

8. Store the generated `deployments/*.json` record with the operational change
   record. Confirm `/api/version` and `/version.json` report the same version,
   commit, and build time.

Migration classification `manual` intentionally cannot use the normal
promotion workflow. Redesign the migration as expand/contract or use a reviewed
maintenance plan outside the routine release process.

## Production-only exception

An unavailable staging environment is not staging evidence. If an urgent
release must go directly to production, open the **Production-only release
exception** issue template and complete every item under **Required production
preconditions**. The issue must remain open as the operational record.

Run **Promote Production Exception** with the candidate and that repository
issue URL. The separate workflow validates the issue marker and completed
preconditions, records `production-exception` in the stable release notes, and
still requires approval through the protected `production` environment. It
validates candidate checksums, source identity, migration classification, and
image digests, but does not claim that staging validation occurred.

Promotion does not deploy the application. After promotion, use the normal
production update command during the recorded maintenance window, complete the
post-deployment checks in the exception issue, attach the deployment record,
and then close the issue. If the preconditions cannot be completed, do not
promote or deploy the candidate.

## First managed deployment

Before replacing a legacy tag-based deployment, capture the images that are
actually running:

```bash
make adopt-current RELEASE=v0.1.3 ENVIRONMENT=production MODE=traefik
```

The command refuses to continue unless Docker can resolve both running images
to registry digests. Repeat separately for staging. Adoption preserves the
running Compose project, writes full digest references to `.env`, and creates a
checksum-validated `baselines/vX.Y.Z` runtime snapshot for exact application
rollback.

## Rollback and restore

An update failure restores the previous runtime configuration and exact image
digests, then stops the public nginx service for inspection. It never runs
`migration:revert`. Routine migrations must therefore remain compatible with
the previous stable backend for at least one release.

An intentional application rollback is explicit:

```bash
make production-rollback RELEASE=vX.Y.Z MODE=traefik
```

For an adopted legacy release without a historical GitHub manifest, the same
command uses the local baseline. It restores the legacy runtime and adds a
temporary Compose image override so the exact captured digests are used rather
than mutable legacy tags. Database migrations are not reverted.

If an incompatible database or filesystem change requires a full recovery,
perform the documented downtime restore from one complete update backup:

```bash
make restore-backup BACKUP=backups/update_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS MODE=traefik
```

The restore stops public/application services, restores both PostgreSQL custom
dumps with `pg_restore`, restores uploads and runtime configuration, restarts
the stack, and verifies health and release identity. Before stopping services,
it verifies `SHA256SUMS` and both tar archives; before replacing database
objects, it validates both custom dumps with `pg_restore --list`. Test this path
in an isolated environment before the first production release.

An isolated stack on a shared Docker host may supply an additional Compose file
and a non-default health URL:

```bash
./scripts/update.sh --mode server --environment staging \
  --release vX.Y.Z-rc.N \
  --compose-override /absolute/path/rehearsal.yml \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

When `--manifest` points to a local file or private URL, the runtime archive and
`SHA256SUMS` must be available beside it. The installer verifies the manifest
and archive against that checksum file before extracting anything. Private
GitHub downloads can use a read-only token through `CONTENT_POOL_GITHUB_TOKEN`
(or `GH_TOKEN`); the token is never written to a deployment record.

## Environment isolation

Staging and production use separate Compose project names, databases, volumes,
domains, `.env` files, and secrets. Staging must not contain production personal
data. New installations set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to `content-pool-staging` or
`content-pool-production`; legacy adoption preserves the running stack's
existing Compose project label. Release bundles contain no secrets.
